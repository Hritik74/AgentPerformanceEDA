![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/903b940e-0a7c-4adf-bcbe-d8138a7a9f23)

## Project Overview  
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on chat support agent performance data collected from the iNeuron EdTech company's website. It evaluates key metrics such as:  
- Weekly performance ratings 
- Working days and contribution hours  
- Number of queries handled  
- Customer feedback received  
- Response and resolution times  

The goal is to identify high and low-performing agents, uncover feedback patterns, and assess productivity to improve overall support efficiency.

## Features  
- **Comprehensive performance breakdown per agent**  
- **Analysis of workload, efficiency, and active hours**  
- **Identification of top-performing and underperforming agents**  
- **Insights into feedback patterns and resolution speed**  
- **Evaluation of how leaves impact performance metrics**  

---

## Visualizations Included  
This project isn’t just about numbers — it brings performance insights to life with visuals:  

- **Total Working Days per Agent** : A vertical bar chart showing the number of days each agent was active, helping to evaluate their availability and consistency.

- **Total Chats Handled per Agent** : A horizontal bar chart displaying the total chats managed by each agent, highlighting workload distribution and top contributors.

- **Ratings Distribution** : A histogram showcasing the spread of agent ratings, pinpointing where most agents stand in terms of performance quality.

- **Chats vs Feedback** : A stacked horizontal bar chart comparing the total chats handled with feedback received per agent; offering a quick view of who handles the most volume and maintains good feedback.

## Key Insights  
- Which agents consistently outperform or underperform?  
- How do leave days impact weekly performance ratings?  
- What patterns emerge in positive and negative feedback?  
- Which agents resolve queries faster without sacrificing quality?  
- How do response times influence customer satisfaction?

## Implementation Tools 
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **CSV/Excel files** for data input
